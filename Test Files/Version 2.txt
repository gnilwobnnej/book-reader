Animal Farm. He's ruthless, manipulative, and ultimately betrays the principles
of the revolution.

but is driven out in a staged coup. He represents idealism and progressive
thought.
* **Old Major:** A wise old boar who inspires the animals with his vision of a
society free from human exploitation. His ideas form the basis of Animalism.

but ultimately naive and exploited by Napoleon. He embodies loyalty and
diligence.

represents common sense and compassion but often fails to see through Napoleon's
manipulations.

**Humans:**

* **Mr. Jones:** The original owner of Manor Farm, he is a cruel and neglectful
farmer who is overthrown by the animals. He symbolizes the oppressive human
class.

self-serving nature of the ruling class. He forms an alliance with Napoleon,
demonstrating the pigs' willingness to cooperate with humans for their own
benefit.

propagandist. He manipulates language and distorts facts to control the other
animals.

You: What are the main themes of the book?
Llama: 
Here are some of the main themes explored in George Orwell's *Animal Farm*:

* **Corruption of Power:** The novel vividly portrays how absolute power
corrupts absolutely.  Initially, the pigs rise to lead with noble intentions,
promising equality and a better life for all animals. However, as they gain
control, they gradually become more self-serving and oppressive, mirroring the
human exploiters they initially revolted against.

* **Totalitarianism and Propaganda:** *Animal Farm* is a powerful allegory for
totalitarian regimes.  The pigs use propaganda (think Squealer's constant
rewriting of history and spreading misinformation) to control the minds of the
other animals, suppress dissent, and maintain their power.

* **Loss of Individuality and Freedom:** The individual needs and desires of the
animals are gradually disregarded as the collective will of the party (the pigs)
becomes paramount.  Animals who question or resist are silenced or punished,
leading to a homogenized society where independent thought is discouraged.

* **The Dangers of Blind Obedience:** Many of the animals on Animal Farm
unquestioningly follow the pigs' orders, even when they become increasingly
unjust. This highlights the danger of blindly accepting authority without
critical thinking and the importance of individual responsibility.

* **Revolution and Betrayal:** The initial revolution on Animal Farm represents
hope for a better future, but it is ultimately betrayed by those who seize
control. The pigs turn the farm into a system even more oppressive than the one
they overthrew, demonstrating that revolutions can sometimes lead to new forms
of tyranny.

* **Social Class and Inequality:** *Animal Farm* explores how social hierarchies
persist even after attempts at revolution. Despite initial promises of equality,
the pigs create a new class system where they are privileged above all other
animals, echoing the inequalities that existed before the rebellion.
