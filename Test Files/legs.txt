You: Are two legs bad?

That's a very insightful question based on the ending of "Animal Farm"!

The story uses the symbolism of legs to represent different groups in power.

* **Two legs** initially symbolized humans, who exploited the animals. The
animals rebelled against this exploitation, believing that two legs represented
oppression and greed.
* **Four legs** symbolized the animals themselves, working together for equality
and a better life.


However, by the end of the novel, the pigs (who have "two legs") have become
indistinguishable from the humans (also "two legs").  This blurring of lines
suggests that:

* **The revolution's goal—equality and freedom from human oppression—has been
twisted.** The pigs, who started as symbols of animal liberation, have adopted
the same exploitative behaviors as the humans they overthrew.
* **Power corrupts.**  Even with good intentions, those in power can become just
like the very people they sought to overthrow.

**So, is "two legs bad"?**

The book doesn't give a simple answer. It suggests that it's not about the
number of legs, but about the actions and intentions behind them.  "Two legs"
became a symbol for oppression, but the pigs show us that power itself can
corrupt, regardless of who holds it.
